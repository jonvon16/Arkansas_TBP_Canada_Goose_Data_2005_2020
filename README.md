# Data associated with Veon et al., Evaluating harvest liberalization strategies on population dynamics of southern latitude temperate-breeding Canada geese
This repository contains 1) Program MARK Arkansas Canada goose banding and encounter data, as well as 2) harvest probability and abundance data/calculations, associated with the manuscript: Veon et al., Evaluating harvest liberalization strategies on population dynamics of southern latitude temperate-breeding Canada geese.

### Arkansas_TBP_Canada_Goose_Data_2005_2020
This file contains the encounter histories used to develop models in Program Mark for the Arkansas temperate-breeding Canada Goose population (2005-2020).

The band number is reported for each individual (between /* */)

The number string that follows is in Live Dead Live Dead (LDLD) format. A “0’ is assigned if the goose was not encountered. A “1” is assigned if the goose was encountered. For example, for CAGO band Number 95856724, the first two zeros in the string represents that the goose was not encountered in the 2005 summer banding season, nor was it harvested in the following 2005-2006 hunting season.

At the end of the LDLD string (to the left of the semicolon), the first of the two numbers represents a “local” or “hatch year” Canada goose at capture. The second of the two numbers represents an “after hatch year” goose at capture.

### ARCAGO_LincolnEstimate_Data_2005_2020
This file contains the calculations, as well as the resulting harvest probabilities and abundance estimates, for the Arkansas temperate-breeding Canada Goose population (2005-2020). Please refer to Veon et al., Evaluating harvest liberalization strategies on population dynamics of southern latitude temperate-breeding Canada geese, for an explanation of how values were derived.
