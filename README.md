This repository contains 1) Program MARK Canada goose banding and encounter data and 2) Lincoln Estimate data and calculations associated with the Veon et al. manuscript titled: Evaluating harvest liberalization strategies on population dynamics of southern latitude temperate-breeding Canada geese.

# Arkansas_TBP_Canada_Goose_Data_2005_2020
This file contains the encounter histories used to develop models in Program Mark for the Arkansas temperate-breeding Canada Goose population (2005-2020).

The band number is reported for each individual (between /* */)

The number string that follows is in Live Dead Live Dead (LDLD) format. A “0’ means the goose was not encountered. A “1” means the goose was encountered. For example, for CAGO band Number 95856724, the first two zeros represent that the goose was not encountered in the 2005 banding season, nor was it harvested in the 2005-2006 waterfowl hunting season.

At the end of the LDLD string (to the left of the semicolon), the first of the two numbers represent a “local” or “hatch year” Canada goose at capture. The second of the two numbers represents an “after hatch year” goose at capture.

# ARCAGO_LincolnEstimate_Data_2005_2020
This file contains the calculations and resulting harvest probabilities and abundance estimates for the Arkansas temperate-breeding Canada Goose population (2005-2020). Please refer to Veon et al., Evaluating harvest liberalization strategies on population dynamics of southern latitude temperate-breeding Canada geese, for an explanation of how values were derived.
